# Covid19_detection
Our project aims to develop an automated COVID-19 detection solution using Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture, leveraging pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. We plan to implement this approach in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, adapting the model to our dataset consisting of COVID-19 and No_findings X-ray images for accurate diagnosis.
